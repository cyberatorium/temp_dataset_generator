# temperature_dataset_generator
script Python yang dimodifikasi untuk mensimulasikan data temperatur suhu dari 5 node sensor suhu dengan jeda waktu 30 menit

Explanation:

    Timestamp: Each row starts with a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, indicating the date and time when the data was recorded.
    Node ID: The second field is the node ID, which identifies the specific node sensor that recorded the data. In this case, the node IDs are node1, node2, node3, node4, and node5, indicating that there are 5 nodes.
    Temperature: The third field is the temperature value in Celsius. The values are formatted with two decimal places for better readability.

This output represents a sample of the temperature data generated by the script. The actual data will vary depending on the random temperature values generated.

Additional Notes:

    The output can be modified to include additional columns, such as humidity, pressure, or node status.
    The output can be saved in different formats, such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
    The output can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, visualization, or real-time monitoring.
